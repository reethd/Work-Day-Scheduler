# module-5-challenge-calendar

This daily calendar displays the current date at the top of the page, allows the the user to input items into text boxes designated to each hour of the working day, provides a save button that saves the user input into local storage, renders any saved user input from local storage to the relevant container, and color codes the hour boxes to show whether or not the hour is current, has passed, or is upcoming.
